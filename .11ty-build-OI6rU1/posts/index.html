    <p>Nx is a modular build framework for architecting and maintaining code projects. Using it means you configure once, then just focus on build your tools and apps. Nx can effectively manage the configuration around APIs, micro frontends and libraries of tools, so you don’t have to consciously think of this step each time it comes to building a new project. This is an article I wrote for the Purple Bricks tech blog on the subject.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s no secret that NextJS is knocked the socks off Gatsby last year in terms of developer adoption. I think the frameworks will keep learning from each other (read: steal features), and it&#39;s a good thing for both frameworks. Here&#39;s my take on what could be announced at Gatsby&#39;s forthcoming conference.</p>

    <p>Websites are great tools for communication, but it&#39;s remarkably easy to take them offline. For those organisations in which there&#39;s a huge financial investment and thousands — perhaps millions - of customers, reliability is a huge concern. The strategies and tools we are looking at here cover both prevention and resolution of problems that could occur to any website.</p>

A well crafted interface that allows people to do this isn&#39;t easy.

    <p>&#39;Form Follows Function&#39; goes the saying, but with HTML forms, it&#39;s the other way round. At least in terms of what happens when you fill out a form, and then click the button to &#39;send&#39;: a function processes the form. What happens during this process? Why is it necessary? What are some of the options for serverless form handling?</p>

    <p>Recently I found out that a close friend of mine whom I had lost touch with had taken his own life. This has had a great impact on me, and still saddens me every time I think of him. I want to share this to document our friendship and share some of the thoughts I&#39;ve had since.</p>

This is currently happening as the W3C push forward with new functionality like Grid and Flexbox, but until those come into general use, we can aim to limit the risk of our code becoming unfathomable by other developers.</p>

    <p>So a few weeks&#39; ago I discovered a very small but excellently designed typeface from a Phitra Design called Skybird. I decided almost at once that I would use it on deliciousreverie, and replace the old typeface, Vollkorn from Google Fonts</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve always felt that my place in the web development industry has been misunderstood. It&#39;s been misunderstood by recruiters, by my employers, and more often that not, by myself as well. But over the past few weeks a new concept has been gaining ground that I identify with closely, and if this catches on, I think it could change the face of our industry.</p>

    <p>Although I&#39;ve really gotten into the SASS revolution, I haven&#39;t yet adopted a method for structuring elements of CSS. I guess it&#39;s because none of them strike me as particularly visual, and being a former print designer, I tend to think in those terms. But something about Brad Frost&#39;s Atomic Design principles makes sense to me. Here&#39;s why.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s vitally important to have success before you start a project-perhaps the most critical stage to have success. But how far should we go in order to get our clients on board? Should we try to wow clients into signoff? Here&#39;s why that is a bad idea.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve recently taken a step back from my work to scope out a process that would make an organisation as efficient, competent and successful as it can be in the hopes of having a clearer understanding of where we are as a company and where we have the opportunity to improve.</p>

    <p>We&#39;ve reached a point that, like the image carousel, sidebars have become overused and for a lot of projects superfluous. And, as I&#39;ve discovered, people don&#39;t always understand the concept or how they work.</p>

    <p>Wordpress is becoming to websites what Facebook is to the Internet in some countries: inseperable. Almost as if you can&#39;t build a website without Wordpress, at least not one that has a Content Management System (CMS). I&#39;m making a case for change.</p>

    <p>I was getting nowhere. For the previous four years, I had been self employed and had managed the transition from print design to web design. I was enjoying life, but then a desire to build on my success as part of a forward thinking and dynamic team motivated me to submit my CV to a number of local agencies.</p>

    <p>A little while ago, I had a telephone interview in which the lead developer customarily dismissed my application because I didn&#39;t know how to write SASS or LESS. He was very born again about the whole thing, and I resolved to learn at least one of these frameworks in response.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s been great to work with some excellent developers recently, but on one or two occasions, like all of us at some point, we&#39;ve had relationships with clients and sometimes suppliers, that have been tested. How can we avoid things that could potentially derail a project in progress? How can we keep staff motivated past the pain points of difficult development and changing requirements?</p>
