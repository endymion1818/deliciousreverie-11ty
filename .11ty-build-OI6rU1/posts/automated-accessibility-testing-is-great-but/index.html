<p><strong>We recently had a situation using jest-axe in tests, where the landmarks feature wasn't work as expected. This helped me verify why we shouldn't rely solely on automated tools, never mind how good they are.</strong></p>
<p>In unit tests for our <a href="https://github.com/zopaUK/react-components">react component library</a> at Zopa, we have utilised <a href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe">jest-axe</a> to test whether our components adhere to a number of accessibility rules.</p>
<p>The funny thing was, when we adhered to the rules (specifically the way components either use semantic HTML or aria roles), further testing in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Google's Lighthouse tool</a> revealed that there were accessibility issues with our components:</p>
<p><strong><em>Some ARIA child roles must be contained by specific parent roles to properly perform their intended accessibility functions.</em></strong></p>
<p>The trouble is that our library contains a lot of components that do not require the use of landmarks. We build our UI pages up from these component pieces, and would utilise landmarks <em>on the page</em> typically.</p>
<p>This rule was forcing our developers to add aria <code>role</code>s where they weren't needed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe/issues/92">You can disable this rule</a>. However, this means that there are far less checks for semantic HTML in our codebase.</p>
<p>I don't think this kind of issue is something that's easily solved by the axe team. It does highlight the flaws in tools like jest-axe: we can't rely solely on them. In fact, right on the Github repo the team identify clearly (in large writing!) that &quot; This project does not guarantee what you build is accessible&quot;, and that &quot;The GDS Accessibility team found that only ~30% of issues are found by automated testing.&quot;</p>
<p>We ultimately decided that ~30% is better than nothing. And <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup, whilst undesirable, is better than using <code>role</code>s where they're misleading. So we disabled this rule and we're going to continue to use jest-axe in our project.</p>

<p>To try to keep our focus on giving all of our users the best experience possible, we have recently created the role of &quot;feature champions&quot; among the frontend community.</p>
<p>These individuals take on a subject that they are passionate about, such as TypeScript, unit testing and, yes, accessibility too, and will occasionally give a quick eye to projects to kindly advise whether we are following best practices.</p>
<p>So much more is needed. Each of us needs to continue to develop empathy for our customers and visitors. And we need to avoid trusting the tools we use for accessibility: they don't always get everything right.</p>
