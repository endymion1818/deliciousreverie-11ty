<p>I have found it very difficult to collect this list together, I go through phases with books and these might be considered my current favourites ... but here goes!</p>
<p>In no strict order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>F Scott Fitzgerald - collected short stories.</strong> Life in the 1920s &amp; 30s with just a pinch of melancholy</li>
<li><strong>John Keats complete poems</strong> - the sheer genius of this 20 year olds ideas was amazing. Such a tragic life too (he died aged 26)</li>
<li><strong>Victor Hugo - les Miserables (translated by Norman Denny).</strong> An undiluted masterpiece, Paris in minature and a lot of fascinating philosophical meandering in between.</li>
<li><strong>James Joyce - Poems &amp; shorter writings.</strong> JJ’s books are unnaproachable but he had a command of English like only Shakespeare, which makes his poetry magnificent.</li>
<li><strong>Virginia Woolf - The Waves.</strong> Just read the opening page. She understood people on such an intrinsic level.</li>
<li><strong>Marcel Proust - Swanns Way.</strong> He takes a long time to get to the point but it’s like climbing a mountain, the view from the peak is indescribably beautiful.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation - Asimov.</strong> The scope of the initial concept for the series is mind boggling.</li>
<li><strong>Frank Herbert - Dune.</strong> world building at its absolute best</li>
<li><strong>Dan Simmons - The Hyperion Cantos.</strong> Requires a bit of a strong stomach but the author loved literature as well as high concept sci fi. Awesome.</li>
<li><strong>China Mieville - Perdido Street Station, Embassytown or The City and the City.</strong> Some incredible concepts about language and world building, writing style is mesmerising and transports you into the his worlds with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Mervyn Peake - Titus Groan.</strong> Brilliant, ponderous, odd, and wonderful.</li>
<li><strong>Jorge Luis Borges - Collected Stories.</strong> Mind bending infinite and looping concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Anne Fadiman - Confessions of a Common Reader.</strong> I re-read this slim volume every few years, a wonderful love letter to books, reading, and life in general.</li>
<li><strong>Boris Pasternak - Doctor Zhivago.</strong> a grand, poetic, and empathic exploration of individuals in Russia in the civil war. &quot;I feel for each of them / As if I were in their skin&quot;, he writes in one of the poems attached to the book.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="honourable-mentions" tabindex="-1">Honourable mentions <a class="direct-link" href="#honourable-mentions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I am halfway through the Illiad, an old translation by a guy called Chapman who kept the original meter from the poem, it’s jolly wordy and doesn’t convey the barbarism of the original (probably a good thing!).</p>
<p>I also recently read Paradise Lost by John Milton. The charachterization is superb and language and turn of phrase is delightful.</p>
<p>Sophie’s World is good for covering the basic concepts of just about every branch of philosophy, in story form too!</p>
<p>I read Robinson Crusoe but the racism and colonialism were stomach churning.</p>
<p>As a biography I loved Seven Pillars of Wisdom by “Lawrence of Arabia”, he’s such a figure but he really loved the Bedouin culture and writes about it so honestly.</p>
