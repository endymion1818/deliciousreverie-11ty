<p><strong>For the past year and a bit, I've worked at Blaze Communication, a marketing agency in Enfield. I've learned so many new things at this company. My knowledge and understanding is far, far different than it was a year ago. Here are some of my observations.</strong></p>
<p>All of these things could be blog posts in their own right; but I'm a fan of brevity.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-sell-change" tabindex="-1">How to Sell Change <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-sell-change" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Right when I started working for Blaze, I got really annoyed and frustrated because I wanted to change how things were done to the way I was used to ... I'd come from an organization working to very different ways of planning and development, and I wanted to implement all of them straight away.</p>
<p>I soon found out that change needed to be justified in terms of benefits. So I looked for opportunities to raise the issues <em>I was most concerned about</em>.</p>
<p>After a few strong - but not unpleasant - conversations in which I challenged the validity of certain processes, I got some of what I wanted.</p>
<p>But I also had to see things from the company's perspective. They weren't interested in implementing things unless they could be convinced of a clear benefit. And I realised that some of the things I wanted to do weren't going to fit.</p>
<p>I guess I learned that Agile also needs to be Agile.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-convince-with-tact" tabindex="-1">How to Convince with Tact <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-convince-with-tact" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>It was clear from day one that design skills (or UX skills) were not to be part of my role. However, I could see a gap in the skills of the team when it came to understanding the users' perspective.</p>
<p>I needed to find a way of doing this tactfully, so I wouldn't offend their sensibilities. I eventually succeeded in doing this by being patient, building trust with my design colleagues, and complimenting them when I felt there was a basis for doing so.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was glad to see more talk of &quot;what's best for the user&quot; near the end of my tenure. I really hope they continue to learn UX based thinking after I move on.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-perform-basic-sysadmin-tasks" tabindex="-1">How to perform basic SysAdmin tasks <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-perform-basic-sysadmin-tasks" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The answer: With Great Caution. The first time I transferred in a domain from somewhere else, I knocked a site out for a few days. Also: because they say DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours doesnt mean it will. It's usually done in an hour or so.</p>
<p>In the last few days I've finished setting up a new server for the company, although a third party did a lot of the leg work it gave me a lot of insight to how these things happen.</p>
<p>Deciding which version of PHP to install, and the different methods of running it, was a real eye opener for me.</p>
<p>Migrating a server with 20+ live sites and many DNS records can be fun :-)</p>
<h3 id="how-to-effectively-maintain-older-sites" tabindex="-1">How to effectively Maintain older sites <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-effectively-maintain-older-sites" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The main thing is, don't be too precious about them. If you need to add a lot of extra Javascript just to get things to perform the way the beief describes, do it.</p>
<p>If it's an older site and otherwise badly needs updating, it shows that the one responsible doesn't care too much about it's upkeep. So why should you invest your care to a greater degree?</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-css-animations" tabindex="-1">How to use CSS Animations <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-use-css-animations" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Because design thinking wasn't part of my remit, I had to find another outlet for my creative thinking. I found plenty of scope in CSS Animations.</p>
<p>When I could see from a design a case for animating something, I would seek a way of doing that in a subtle way. I found that softening page transitions and hover states gave me a way of using time as a canvas.</p>
<p>Here's a recent site, that was designed buy our in-house team, but with some added animations:</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff" tabindex="-1">Other stuff <a class="direct-link" href="#other-stuff" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>How to build a Wordpress theme from scratch, how to use SASS, how to remove a hacked site from blacklists (once cleaned), how to build extensibly, how to manage &amp; support remote developers, how to build a theme that's easily translateable, how to train clients in the use of their CMS.</p>
<p>And probably tonnes more things.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="direct-link" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>It's been a fascinating year and I've learned a huge amount. I can't wait to get stuck into other work, and hope that I can accelerate and deepen my knowledge by doing so.</p>
