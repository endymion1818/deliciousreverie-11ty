<p><strong>I've been using the esteemed <a href="https://github.com/rachelbaker/bootstrapwp-Twitter-Bootstrap-for-WordPress/tree/bootstrap3" title="Rachel Baker's BootstrapWP on GitHub">Rachel Baker's BootstrapWP</a> theme for a while, but recently I decided to build my own Wordpress / Bootstrap starter theme. Here's why I took this step and what I plan to do with it in the future.</strong></p>
<p>There's still an argument raging about whether or not web developers should use Bootstrap or Foundation as a UI starting point for their projects. I don't want to undermine the very valid and extremely important role of UX / UI design. We do want to avoid every site looking the same (current trends notwithstanding).</p>
<h3 id="once-more-unto-the-breach-dear-friends-..." tabindex="-1">Once More Unto The Breach, Dear Friends ... <a class="direct-link" href="#once-more-unto-the-breach-dear-friends-..." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, I really think that Bootstrap, Foundation and the rest have raised the bar for good UI design significantly.</p>
<p>For example, where I work we do a lot of work for smaller clients who don't have the budget for a developer to work on a site for over a month, doing everything from scratch. To better serve this range of client, and to avoid going the route of using someone elses potentially un-semantic, bloated and non-extensible paid-for theme, we decided to construct a Wordpress Bootstrap starter theme.</p>
<p>This way, we can have more control over our code, we can keep more projects in-house, and still raise the standard of production for these smaller clients.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-a-theme-with-wordpress-and-bootstrap" tabindex="-1">Crafting a Theme with Wordpress and Bootstrap <a class="direct-link" href="#crafting-a-theme-with-wordpress-and-bootstrap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>It's not the purpose of this post to list everything the theme contains. In fact, it's far from complete and as I use it on live projects in the coming months, I'll no doubt add functionality I find useful / desireable. But I have started off by adding the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu item CSS styles (replaced Bootstrap's .active with Wordpress' .current-menu-item etc)</li>
<li>Breadcrumb support</li>
<li>Better pagination (the page will display a UL list of pages, instead of just &quot;older&quot; and &quot;newer&quot; links)</li>
<li>Uncompressed and deregistered Jetpack's CSS file by default (because there's just no need for bloat).</li>
</ul>
<p>You might see that I'm on a personal mission to end needless bloat as much as I reasonably can.</p>
<h3 id="other-nice-things" tabindex="-1">Other Nice Things <a class="direct-link" href="#other-nice-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>I've also added a sample <code>wp-config.php</code> file that allows you to add your local, development environment and live database information all in one, so you don't have to worry about overwriting the file when you commit a change or upload a batch of files.</p>
<p>There's a sample <code>htaccess</code> file too, adding support for <code>svg</code> files. I frequently encountered that this was turned off by default on the servers I've been working on. Because SVGs are so useful especially for logos, I've enabled this on Apache / NGIX servers using this code snippet.</p>
<p>The <code>htaccess</code> file also adds support for <code>mod_deflate</code> too, so gZipping can be enabled easily. This is something I found I was forgetting to do once a project was going live, so this helped me to streamline my processes.</p>
<h3 id="what's-not-there" tabindex="-1">What's not there <a class="direct-link" href="#what's-not-there" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Template files are virtually non-existant in this theme, outside of the Wordpress standard pages <code>index</code>, <code>page</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>front-page</code>. I have included a template for a <code>sitemap</code> page.</p>
<p>More templates will follow when I have the time, possibly <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples" title="example pages constructed with Bootstrap">using the existing starter templates</a> or when I've worked on a project that contains some particularly useful, challenging or interesting templates.</p>
<h3 id="updates" tabindex="-1">Updates <a class="direct-link" href="#updates" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>This project will be updated and maintained regularly. I'm particularly interested by <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2014/10/29/bootstrap-3-3-0-released/" title="Bootstrap blog post containing info about Bootstrap 4">the roadmap to Bootstrap 4</a>, and can't wait to incorporate it here (although I personally might wait until 4.1 before I use it in production).</p>
<h3 id="there-you-have-it." tabindex="-1">There you have it. <a class="direct-link" href="#there-you-have-it." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>There you go, <a href="https://github.com/endymion1818/blazebase/" title="Link to Blaze Base starter Wordpress theme">feel free to download this starter theme</a>.
