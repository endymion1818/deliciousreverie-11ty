<p><strong>I've been hearing a lot of different, seemingly contradictory messages from the industry in recent weeks regarding frontend frameworks and progressive enhancement. I got so frustrated that I started a discussion on Web Freelancers Hub about it. I felt the answers that came back were worth documenting.</strong></p>
<p>My original post to the group:</p>
<p>So, I'm really confused.</p>
<p>There's been a huge demand for people who can work with Frontend frameworks especially Angular.js in recent months. For a while, it seemed like I was turning down 5 contracts a week that required this skill.. which I'm now learning.</p>
<p>But now the industry seems to be eating is tail &amp; saying this is bad practice because what if users don't have Javascript enabled on their browser (for whatever reason)... and I agree with them.</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused / frustrated with these mixed messages — I really agree with recent posts from <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9963" title="Where to Start? on Adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a> and <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/interaction-is-an-enhancement" title="Interaction is an Enhancement on A List Apart">Aaron Gustaffson</a> but don't know the best route to take to</p>
<p>a) stay ahead of the game</p>
<p>b) provide the best experience for users.</p>
<p>Anyone else thinking this / have a take on it?</p>
<hr>
<p>Although there were a few developers who argued that when developing apps, you have to stipulate to users that JS must be enabled, Nick Bramwell was quick to comment in a way that resonated with me: &quot;I’ve been burnt too many times in the past learning things that quickly vanish.&quot;</p>
<p>This is one thing that I've been afraid of, since it takes a lot of time to learn frameworks ... and I have a young baby to take care of!</p>
<p>Rachel Andrew mentioned a use case that I don't think we consider enough: &quot;I travel a lot, end up on terrible wifi. At least once per trip I find myself unable to use a site because bits of their JavaScript haven't made it.&quot; This is also what motivated <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design" title="Responsible Responsive Design on A Book Apart">Scott Jehl to write his book &quot;Responsible Responsive Design&quot;</a>.</p>
<h3 id="browsers-are-browsers" tabindex="-1">Browsers Are Browsers <a class="direct-link" href="#browsers-are-browsers" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>So I guess my position is that there may be certain cases we would justifiably use fronted frameworks to enhance the experience for the user, we shouldn't make it a requirement of our site. Browsers are meant to be used to view and interact with data, and largely cannot be 'exploited' — partly because users need protection from such things.</p>
<p>I guess that if responsive design has taught me one thing, it's that we <em>can't know</em> the conditions under which our site will be served up to someone, and that we shouldn't try to know, or to stipulate conditions unless there is a very good reason for doing so.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to be part of a community that I can go to when issues like this come up. For now, I'm going to stick with what I've learned with regard to fronted frameworks. Perhaps I might start learning server-side (universal, or isomorphic) JavaScript, because I seem to enjoy seeing what's possible with the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems that my gut feeling is that I need to stick to my principles and not be swayed by lucrative offers that I might receive that could result in a dead end.</p>
