<p>Today was a stressful day. I was working to a set deadline on which a lot of other tasks depended. I felt that if I failed to achieve my work, there would be a cascade effect that could lead to delaying the release of a product I have been working on.</p>
<p>I didn't want that to happen. But I'm not proud of what I did to avoid it.</p>
<p>I was working with our best designer, who had begun to refactor a module but needed some help with some finer structure and more complicated CSS that would display the images in the way that the Creative Director had approved.</p>
<p>In order to hit my deadline I hacked the module I was working on. I added props that were not semantically correct. I added images directly into the module itself instead of passing them down from the page. I wrote no tests and defined no types.</p>
<p>After another round of tweaks and some refinements, it was ready for code review. I rushed it past, asking someone I knew would be too busy to tell me what I should've done instead. I'm sure he raised an eyebrow or two when he approved it.</p>
<p>Miraculously, it passed QA and was released that same day.</p>
<p>I still hate myself whenever I think of that code.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-consequences" tabindex="-1">Unexpected Consequences <a class="direct-link" href="#unexpected-consequences" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We started a new sprint today, and one of the backlog items is a refactor of that module. This time I'm going to do it correctly, passing down the image from the page, removing the duplicate CSS and finding a way for our designer to pass specific CSS so they can position the image as they want.</p>
<p>What I didn't expect was to hear that our user engagement has increased significantly. Conversions are up by about 11%, and the project is much closer to launch than it would have been without those hacky changes I made.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not at all proud of the code I wrote today.</p>
<p>But it helped the whole project move forward. It might even release very soon. And now I'm going to re-do it properly.</p>
<p>You don't have to be proud of the code you wrote today. But you can do what's needed, and make a promise to do it properly when time allows.</p>
