<p><strong>A little while ago, I had a telephone interview in which the lead developer customarily dismissed my application because I didn't know how to write SASS or LESS. He was very &quot;born again&quot; about the whole thing, and I resolved to learn at least one of these frameworks in response.</strong></p>
<p>Whilst I'm very glad I did learn SASS, I have to say there are a number of drawbacks I've noticed ...</p>
<h3 id="drawback-1:-increase-code-stack" tabindex="-1">Drawback 1: Increase Code Stack <a class="direct-link" href="#drawback-1:-increase-code-stack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>SASS is written in Ruby. Whilst I would love to get into coding in Ruby, it's not something I wanted to learn as a priority—I'm having enough trouble picking up enough other skills more pertinent to frontend development.</p>
<p>I do use Grunt in my workflow, because I'm a performance freak and hate to see unminified scripts and multiple HTTP calls when there could be one. So that's already added Node.js to my workflow.</p>
<p>But the problem I ran into when developing in SASS was that I had to leave the code base alone for a few months ... and when I came back to it, it wasn't doing what I expected. I had to seriously dig around to find out that I needed to update to the latest version of Ruby (which of the several package manager solutions had I used again??!) and Node.js before it would run again.</p>
<p>I was working on this site, as it happens, so it wasn't all that important. But I have heard too much experience of developers who spend a greater portion of their time fixing their environments instead of contributing to the project at hand, to not take this seriously.</p>
<h3 id="drawback-2:-it-does't-run-on-your-server" tabindex="-1">Drawback 2: It Does't Run On Your Server <a class="direct-link" href="#drawback-2:-it-does't-run-on-your-server" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Okay, so developing your project whilst its on the staging server might not be the best route to take ... but who hasn't had that last-minute code change that the client wants to see just before their conference call—or you just want to try something live to see if your hunch is correct.</p>
<p>But of course you can't do that with SASS unless you happen to have Node.js running on your server. With this project, I didn't, and so was ham strung once again.</p>
<p>Actually, that's my currently roadblock with this site as I write this: I have in mind some CSS changes, but my dev environment is on my Mac at work ... and with a small child the only time I get to mess with my Macbook is when he's asleep (like right now).</p>
<h3 id="don't-knock-a-good-thing" tabindex="-1">Don't Knock A Good Thing <a class="direct-link" href="#don't-knock-a-good-thing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>These drawbacks notwithstanding, I do love SASS. It's so handy having variables, and being able to split down your stylesheets into easily-manageable parts has saved me lines of code and not a few headaches.</p>
<p>It's fantastic to see If Only the CSS specification was a little more ahead of the curve, instead of way behind where it currently is. I can't wait to see the wonderful tools we use in SASS freed from their current shackles.</p>
