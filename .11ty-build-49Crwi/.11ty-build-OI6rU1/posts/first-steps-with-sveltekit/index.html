<p><strong>Svelte is a new framework for JavaScript ... hear me out! It does seem to some people that there's a new JavaScript framework out every day. And there are a lot of new ones at the minute. But SvelteKit is great for one reason: performance. And it's this above everything else (except accessibility) that I'm excited about.</strong></p>
<p>Svelte does have a lot of things going for it. It's as nice (if not nicer) to develop with than React, and getting started is a lot, lot quicker.</p>
<p>These days, if you're going to build a site with React, you either go with the slightly walled garden of create-react-app, or something like Next or Gatsby. Vue has it's own set of these problems too.</p>
<p>However Svelte ... isn't just a framework. It's a compiler too. This facilitates much smaller bundle sizes:</p>
<p><img src="/img/moviano-jsframeworkcomparison.png" alt="Here's a comparison of some common JS frameworks" title="Chart showing popular JS frameworks as of today: React is hugely popular, but also much larger in size than others. Svelte has the smallest bundle size."></p>
<p>React is 42.2kb including react-dom. By comparison, Preact is 4kb. By contrast, Svelte is 1.6kb. That blows my mind.</p>
<p>In our day of multi-megabyte downloads for some websites (that I've seen), Svelte could really turn the tide.</p>
<h2 id="developer-experience" tabindex="-1">Developer experience <a class="direct-link" href="#developer-experience" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The other thing I want to talk about is the developer experience of Svelte. It's very pleasant to work with. Writing components <em>feels</em> a lot more like writing native HTML and CSS. There were certainly some unusual (to me) augmentations, for example writing conditional blocks has an unusual syntax, with <code>{ #if }</code> and <code>{ /if}</code> either side of the condition.</p>
<p>I have to say, I do kinda prefer React's slightly more JavaScript-y approach.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  condition <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>div<span class="token operator">></span>conditional item<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>div<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>However, when it comes to rendering HTML content, it's much more succinct.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>@html htmlContent<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Don't get me wrong, that reminder is pretty useful. However once you're familiar with the concept, it's not exactly a big deal any more.</p>
<h2 id="sveltekit-vs-nextjs-vs-gatsby" tabindex="-1">SvelteKit vs NextJS vs Gatsby <a class="direct-link" href="#sveltekit-vs-nextjs-vs-gatsby" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>SvelteKit is definitely going more the route of NextJS rather than Gatsby. Gatsby is a little more prescriptive and great for newer developers (or those short on time), but NextJS allows much more freedom.</p>
<p>Similar to NextJS, SvelteKit will have options for rendering with SSG / SSR or on the client, and different adapters for interfacing with serverless functions from different providers.</p>
<p>This means you have to fetch data your own way, either on the client or server, and that means you have to be a bit more aware of the performance costs involved.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't find any reference to how you build a NextJS that compiles at build time, that doesn't send any JavaScript to the client. Yet, that's one of the excellent things about SvelteKit: I easily configured my site to send exactly <em>no clientside javascript</em> to the browser, and it works perfectly!</p>
<h2 id="my-project" tabindex="-1">My project <a class="direct-link" href="#my-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>You can take a look at my live project at <a href="https://promatt.co.uk">https://promatt.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote this small site using a starter built by <a href="https://scottspence.com/2021/05/06/graphcms-svelte-strter/">Scott Spence</a>. It fetches data from <a href="https://graphcms.com">GraphCMS</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. I've used <a href="https://formspree.io">Formspree</a> to forward emails from the /contact page to my friend's email address, but I could have just as easily done that with a serverless function.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="direct-link" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>There's one other project I've got my eye on that will trump SvelteKit for my tool of choice. I think it's a great challenge to other frameworks, and I really hope it starts some kind of &quot;performance war&quot; where the performance costs of frameworks are driven down by competition in the space.</p>
<p>Even if that doesn't happen, SvelteKit is a wonderful addition to the JavaScript developers' tool belt.</p>
