<p><strong>Is it just me or does Apple's iCloud seem like a very simple solution to a problem all of us in a connected world face? That of storing, managing and sharing photos of our loved ones, holidays and interests with others?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of being faced with ever increasing charges from Apple to store my stuff, I decided to get a solution I could be more in control of.</p>
<h2 id="you-will-need" tabindex="-1">You Will Need <a class="direct-link" href="#you-will-need" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I could have done this project by setting it up on my own existing home computer, but I already had a spare laptop that had been given to me. I also thought it would give me the freedom to wipe everything and start again if I messed it up irreversibly (which, coincidentally, did end up happening!).</p>
<p>I decided that I'd like to use the current LTS issue of Debian for my hosting platform. I liked the idea of using a bare bones OS, something that I hoped I would be able to customise and learn with. I installed this OS and got to know it, especially how to update and install core and third party packages.</p>
<p>The main commands for this are:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt-get</span> update<br>$ <span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt-get</span> upgrade<br>$ <span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt-get</span> dist-upgrade</code></pre>
<h4 id="first-hitch:-packages-not-upgrading" tabindex="-1">First hitch: Packages not upgrading <a class="direct-link" href="#first-hitch:-packages-not-upgrading" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>About the first thing I noticed when I went into the Terminal app from the GUI was this message that I could upgrade packages, but when I tried to install stuff, it said that no packages were updated.</p>
<p>After some research, I found out it was because I needed to extend the Sources list to include some other sources, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList">as explained on the wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I was then able to install the AMP stack (Apache, Mysql, Php) and it gave me immense pleasure to see a &quot;hello world&quot; message when I added a php file to the www directory.</p>
<h4 id="second-hitch:-permissions" tabindex="-1">Second hitch: Permissions <a class="direct-link" href="#second-hitch:-permissions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>At this point, I found that I was having trouble getting the right permissions for PHP and MySQL to operate.</p>
<p>I didn't know at the time that the solution is to create a new group (its usually &quot;www&quot;), add the current user to the group, then add the user used by Apache (www-data) to this group.</p>
<h4 id="third-hitch:-sharing" tabindex="-1">Third hitch: Sharing <a class="direct-link" href="#third-hitch:-sharing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>At this point, I got stuck trying to see how to see my website from another computer in my local network. It seemed that whatever IP I went to, nothing worked.</p>
<p>I went down a bit of a maze, installing Samba file sharing system before second-guessing myself into the belief that I had taken a serious wrong turn somewhere previously. And now I had Samba, NFS and other file sharing services turned on, potentially exposing my computer to weaknesses.</p>
<p>So in order to progress quickly and avoid having to retrace all my steps, I wiped the computer.</p>
<p>It might seem a little drastic, that, but it did get me out of that situation quickly!!</p>
<h2 id="second-attempt" tabindex="-1">Second Attempt <a class="direct-link" href="#second-attempt" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Even though there were a lot of reasons to like Debian I decided that the community support just wasn't there for me. It's not a criticism: those who use Debian really know what they're doing, but for that reason it's hard to find support for it.</p>
<p>Also, I knew that Ubuntu came with a lot of the things I would need preinstalled.</p>
<p>So I downloaded Ubuntu Server, reformatted my install USB, and started again!</p>
<p>This time I discovered the <code>ifconfig</code> command really quickly on support sites, and was very soon able to use SSH to log in to my new server. That was an amazing moment for me!</p>
<p>Soon after that, I installed RSA keys and was able to log in much more easily and safely to my device. I went on to install &amp; configure my AMP stack, and this time view my Hello World app right from my laptop.</p>
<p>I uploaded a website I'd been building that would serve as a replacement for our current iCloud workflow, which required a few tweaks to permissions again (creating a group for www-data user as I mentioned above) and could access the site.</p>
<h2 id="port-forwarding" tabindex="-1">Port Forwarding <a class="direct-link" href="#port-forwarding" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I went into my router's control panel and turned on port forwarding for my web's default port. Almost instantly, I saw my website ... but could no longer access my routers control panel!!</p>
<p>This suits me for now, because I don't have to worry about any other ports being open, and so there's also less vulnerability for my router. But I also don't have SSH access from outside my home network.</p>
<p>I'm going to fix this, but I don't currently have the headspace to go in and configure it and my port forwarding again.</p>
<h2 id="changing-ip-addresses" tabindex="-1">Changing IP Addresses <a class="direct-link" href="#changing-ip-addresses" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>At first, I was amazed at how quickly my home IP address would change. I realised that if I wanted to reduce outages, I needed a method to keep my site live enough for it to be useful by our family.</p>
<p>I now have a free plan with No-Ip, which has installed a program on my server to update a DNS server when my IP address changes. If this works successfully, I will likely get a paid pla, unless I can figure out how to do it myself!</p>
<h4 id="fourth-hitch:-uploading-files-using-the-cms" tabindex="-1">Fourth hitch: Uploading files using the CMS <a class="direct-link" href="#fourth-hitch:-uploading-files-using-the-cms" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>I how had a working website I could use and refine. But when I tried to upload files I came across an error where the file could be uploaded, but couldn't be moved to the content directory.</p>
<p>Again, this was a permissions issue I had, where I needed to give the &quot;nobody&quot; user the ability to write to disc. I did this by adding this account to the user group I had created earlier.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1">Conclusions <a class="direct-link" href="#conclusions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Setting up my own home server has been frustrating at times, but its taught me a lot about the underlying technologies of the web.</p>
<p>Given that, I'd really like to try other projects in the future that will help me to better understand how browsers and the internet work.</p>
