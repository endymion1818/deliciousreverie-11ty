<p><strong>I've been in &amp; out of love with Bob Dylan for many years. I started listening in my early 20's, bought a compilation album, but I have to say that I just didn't get it. Now, 16 years later, I'm listening to every album he's produced so far.</strong></p>
<p>I guess I might be a glutton for punishment, some of the albums aren't that easy to listen to. But I want to just chart this journey because Dylan is someone who demands constant reassessment. Every time you think you've got the guy sussed, he does something you don't expect.</p>
<p>My favourite albums up to this point are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time Out of Mind</li>
<li>The Freewheelin'</li>
<li>Love and Theft</li>
<li>Blood on the Tracks</li>
<li>Desire</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Time out of Mind</strong> is because that's the album that got me into Dylan initially; when I heard it I was in a very sultry space and every track suited that atmosphere like it was made for me.</p>
<p><strong>The Freewheelin'</strong> is full of uniqueness and perspective that you just don't expect from someone that young, especially being his second album.</p>
<p><strong>Love and Theft</strong> was the third album I bought and I really didn't expect it's timelessness, antiquity and dry humour. I also love the F Scott Fitzgerald quotes peppered throughout the album.</p>
<p><strong>Blood on the Tracks.</strong> Such raw loss gets my attention every time. This is a very personal album from Dylan, and it's isolation and pain comes through loud and clear. And then there's &quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts&quot; which is a blindside.</p>
<p>The duets with Emmylou Harris on <strong>Desire</strong> work so well, but for me this album is more about atmosphere. I love the Southern American feel to what Dylan is doing here. &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; is a great track, even though I'm not a fan of the Spaghetti Western, I can't help being drawn into that atmosphere listening to this track.</p>
<hr>
<p>OK so that's it for this one. Bit of an oddball post, but I really want to see what I think ... my next album is &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, which might not change my opinions at all ... although, like I said, constant reassessment is what Dylan, I think, wants from his audience.</p>
