    <p>I&#39;ve always felt that my place in the web development industry has been misunderstood. It&#39;s been misunderstood by recruiters, by my employers, and more often that not, by myself as well. But over the past few weeks a new concept has been gaining ground that I identify with closely, and if this catches on, I think it could change the face of our industry.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve always been interested in psychology but never went further than college with it. Recently a friend introduced me to the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Test. It illuminated some important traits of my personality and hilighted the motivation behind the goals I have. I thought I&#39;d go over a few points that interested me here.</p>

    <p>Project managers (and clients) view time very differently from developers. It&#39;s not just in the way we structure our thinking in order to work, but in order to plan and decide too. On 2 occasions recently I have been able to manage expectations better in order to allow both managers and developers the space to complete their respective tasks.</p>

    <p>Developers sometimes get asked to do stuff for free. If that happens, it generally can be a warning sign that would be right to steer well clear of. It&#39;s easy to end up feeling cheated. But I&#39;ve been fortunate to be involved in two projects that, although I earned no money from, I felt that I benefited greatly.</p>

    <p>I was getting nowhere. For the previous four years, I had been self employed and had managed the transition from print design to web design. I was enjoying life, but then a desire to build on my success as part of a forward thinking and dynamic team motivated me to submit my CV to a number of local agencies.</p>

    <p>A little while ago, I had a telephone interview in which the lead developer customarily dismissed my application because I didn&#39;t know how to write SASS or LESS. He was very born again about the whole thing, and I resolved to learn at least one of these frameworks in response.</p>
