    <p>It&#39;s no secret that NextJS is knocked the socks off Gatsby last year in terms of developer adoption. I think the frameworks will keep learning from each other (read: steal features), and it&#39;s a good thing for both frameworks. Here&#39;s my take on what could be announced at Gatsby&#39;s forthcoming conference.</p>

    <p>reduce() has terrified me for some time! I hadn&#39;t wanted to touch this new array method because I couldn&#39;t quite follow what each of it&#39;s properties meant. But recently I had an opportunity to deep dive into this function. Here&#39;s how I refactored an object to get the results I needed</p>

    <p>Structuring components in a reusable, discoverable way has been a challenge for some recent projects I&#39;ve worked on. I&#39;ve seen different approaches used, but now I think I&#39;ve found a method that&#39;s basically intuitive, avoids duplication of effort and facilitates easy discovery of components.</p>

    <p>In order for people outside of the development team or community to use your software, care must be given to allow them to write and publish content with the least amount of friction or obstruction as possible. A well crafted interface that allows people to do this isn&#39;t easy. I have started to use Strapi as a serverless backend API interface recently and believe it&#39;s going to be a very useful solution for a lot of projects.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve worked in a few different capacities around the web, and can see the value of interfaces that those writing content for the web feel comfortable using. I&#39;m also becoming more comfortable with JavaScript, and want to find alternatives to the PHP tools I&#39;ve been using. On that journey, I discovered Strapi.</p>

    <p>You&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s not a huge amount of posts about JavaScript on my site. That&#39;s not an accident, I&#39;m really only beginning to gain my feet with the language. Despite this I took the plunge and decided to build a Wordpress theme that uses Backbone.js to render the posts in a list. Here&#39;s a bit about the project.</p>
