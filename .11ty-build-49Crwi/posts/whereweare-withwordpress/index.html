<p><strong>Wordpress is becoming to websites what Facebook is to the Internet in some countries: inseperable. Almost as if you can't build a website without Wordpress, at least not one that has a Content Management System (CMS). I'm making a case for change.</strong></p>
<p>I'm posting this in Project Management because I am certain that the current culture about the use of the hugely popular Wordpress isn't just a developer problem—it's one of best practice in project management.</p>
<h3 id="here's-the-problem." tabindex="-1">Here's the Problem. <a class="direct-link" href="#here's-the-problem." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Wordpress is in its heyday. Its never been so popular. <a href="https://managewp.com/14-surprising-statistics-about-wordpress-usage" title="Manage WP Blog - where this statistic came from.">18.9% of all websites</a> use it to allow clients and customers to upload their own content, write articles and change images on the website.</p>
<p>Wordpress is a convenient tool—there's a remarkably short learning curve for developers and content writers. There are more plugins, widgets and themes than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p>But it's almost too easy. Want a CMS? Use Wordpress. No thought required. I think that level of complacency is a risky business that we ought to be on guard about.</p>
<h4 id="problem-1:-ubiquity-equals-target" tabindex="-1">Problem 1: Ubiquity Equals Target <a class="direct-link" href="#problem-1:-ubiquity-equals-target" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>Because it's so popular it's a constant target. I monitor &amp; maintain over 30 Wordpress sites and get reports every minute about attempted access from bots designed to target weak points in the framework.</p>
<p>But a patch is never as good as avoiding the problem in the first place. If you want to scare yourself silly on this subject, <a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/index.html" title="The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security">read this post</a>.</p>
<h4 id="problem-2:-performance" tabindex="-1">Problem 2: Performance <a class="direct-link" href="#problem-2:-performance" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>Has anyone got Wordpress to grade 'A' on ySlow? <a href="https://twitter.com/matthillco/status/568031045699932160" title="Mat Hill's tweet about Wordpress speeds">Matt Hill responded</a> that it might be possible with a cache plugin ... but it's not an easy thing to achieve, of this I'm certain.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that site performance is having more and more impact on SEO. This is the next frontier for development after responsive images. It's awful that the <a href="https://www.webperformancetoday.com/2013/06/05/web-page-growth-2010-2013/" title="Blog post on Web Performance Today about the size of web pages.">average site size is now 2MB</a>. This can really hurt users-and not those with edge use cases.</p>
<h4 id="problem-3:-content" tabindex="-1">Problem 3: Content <a class="direct-link" href="#problem-3:-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>I don't know about you, but I find it frustrating having one content area for a site, but sometimes regret having to use Advanced Custom Fields or hard coding the site to accept extra content areas.</p>
<p>I really like Perch for its freedom in this. Want an extra field on your posts? Just add a line in the template, and you're done.</p>
<p>Too often I find myself going into the text editor in a Wordpress page to add elements to allow me to fill my client's requests.</p>
<h4 id="problem-4:-maintainability" tabindex="-1">Problem 4: Maintainability <a class="direct-link" href="#problem-4:-maintainability" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p>When is the last time you updated your wordpress installation? How many of these plugins need updates ... and how many updates will break the site?</p>
<p>I don't know!</p>
<p>And yet, not updating <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html" title="A plugin vulnerability that led to many sites being hacked.">could lead to your worst nightmare</a>. This quickly becomes an eternity of procrastination. But by not making a decision, you have made a decision: wait for something bad to happen before you fix it.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of this.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-our-options" tabindex="-1">What Are Our Options? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-are-our-options" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Yes it might require more brain power to think about these things at the start of a project. But there are plenty of surprisingly good options available.</p>
<p>We've decided to keep 3 different CMS systems in mind for our future projects. We're keeping Wordpress for quick, small projects.</p>
<p>Then, we're using <a href="https://grabaperch.com" title="Perch website">Perch or Perch Runway</a> for other sites, and we're looking into using <a href="https://getkirby.com/" title="Kirby website">Kirby</a> as a 3rd option, just to vary the DNA of our projects. After all, if every Wordpress site becomes compromised <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29846539" title="BBC News: Millions of websites hit by Drupal hack attack">like Drupal was</a>, it'll be good to know we don't have quite as much work to do.</p>
<p>So, Wordpress is still a valuable part of what my company do ... but it's not ubiquitous, and it certainly does not need to be the only tool in your toolbox.</p>
<p>After all, this important decision requires some thought, doesn't it?</p>
