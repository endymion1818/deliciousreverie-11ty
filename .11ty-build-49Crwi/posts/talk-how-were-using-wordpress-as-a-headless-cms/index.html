<p><strong>I'm not a stranger to public speaking. But speaking on a technical subject? To people who are smarter than me? Not something I relish. Yet, I felt I had something to offer the WordPress community, so I volunteered to speak at one of the UK's biggest WordPress meetups, WordCamp London.</strong></p>
<p>UPDATE: Here's the talk hosted on <a href="http://Wordpress.tv">Wordpress.tv</a>:</p>

<p>Ever since starting my web development career I've wanted to be in the place where I could help other developers out with their development dilemmas. It's taken me a long time to get to this stage, and it's only because of some great help from the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Geary</li>
<li>David Hewitt</li>
<li>Steve Woodall</li>
<li>Louise Towler</li>
</ul>
<p>It's thanks to them imparting their knowledge and expertise (and sometimes their time), as well as others, that I have anything that might be considered worthy of sharing.</p>
<h2 id="the-talk" tabindex="-1">The Talk <a class="direct-link" href="#the-talk" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>There's a <a href="https://indigotree.co.uk/how-use-wordpress-headless-cms/">full writeup on the Indigo Tree website</a>. I'll update this post with the video on WordPress TV when it's uploaded there.</p>
<p>My talk covered these main points:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a headless (or decoupled) CMS</li>
<li>Why use WordPress as a headless CMS</li>
<li>Tools and process of building a headless site</li>
<li>A basic example and some gotchas we found</li>
<li>The Future is (probably) headless</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://2018.london.wordcamp.org/session/how-were-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/">You can find it on the conference website too.</a></p>
<h2 id="the-slides" tabindex="-1">The Slides <a class="direct-link" href="#the-slides" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Indigo Tree have <a href="https://wpheadless.indigotree.co.uk/1">kindly published the slides I made here</a>. The slides are a case in point, because it's a GatsbyJS site with a WordPress backend! How's that for recursion ha ha!</p>
<h2 id="the-experience" tabindex="-1">The experience <a class="direct-link" href="#the-experience" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>... was terrifying, to say the least! I rattled through it all in less than 30 mins (I had been given 35 minutes), but there were some really great comments &amp; questions from the audience that I found fascinating. I'm currently planning a series of blog posts on some of the questions that were raised.</p>
<p>Overall, even though this kind of thing doesn't come naturally to me, it's a way of creating a dialog with other great people in communities, and gives others a chance to think about new ways of working. And I enjoy that, as well as to think that maybe I'm helping a few people to solve their development dilemmas.</p>
