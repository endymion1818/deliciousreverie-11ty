        <h1>The Music of Mike Oldfield</h1>

<time datetime="2017-07-09">09 Jul 2017</time><a href="/tags/music/" class="post-tag">music</a>

<p><strong>I've enjoyed the music of Mike Oldfield since I was about 15. Wow, I've just realised that's about 20 years. What makes me keep coming back to this artist? What tracks would I recommend if you wanted to get an overview of his work?</strong></p>
<p>I used to hang out with a group of kids who loved all kinds of music. I admit that I didn't have much of an idea myself, but took on board their recommendations, and quite early on one of them gave me a cassette tape of &quot;Tubular Bells 2&quot;.</p>
<p>I had never heard of the artist before, but that wasn't unusual. What impressed me initially were the titles of some of the tracks. &quot;Weightless&quot;, &quot;Blue Dawn&quot; and &quot;Sentinel&quot; sounded awesome to this hapless, sci-fi loving word-nerd. But when I stuck it in my stereo, it was the sound that really amazed me.</p>

<p>Looking back now on the albums released around that time, I can see this one represented a clear shift in Mike's style. For years he'd been releasing albums of rock music, with tracks typically around 5 minutes, lots of prominent vocals by mostly unknown artists, and some outstanding music and guitar solos.</p>

<p>Over the years, my favourite albums from this era have become &quot;Islands&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Crises&quot;, with the latter being the most challenging and rewarding of the three.</p>
<h2 id="paradigm-shift" tabindex="-1">Paradigm Shift <a class="direct-link" href="#paradigm-shift" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>But this album, Tubular Bells 2, was a paradigm shift. When &quot;Songs of Distant Earth&quot; was released a short time later, I instantly bought the CD (for £18 I might add). I listened to it constantly for years.</p>
<p>This album still is my absolute favourite. It's sublime arrangements, for me at least, defy any genre classification. They instill in me a sense of wonder that only the TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; has managed to compete with.</p>
<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5KoUHqhv8cqqAZ4LwyeJG9" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>At the time, I was getting into James Joyce. His idea of the &quot;literary epiphany&quot;, a moment when you might percieve some kind of absolute beauty, I think is expressed by this album. Loved it.</p>
<p>Over the next few years I soaked up everything Mike published, which morphed into a dance / trance influenced style, I am told which came from living on the island of Ibiza.</p>
<p>I think of this era of ending with the very left-field classical album &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;. Mike doesn't talk about this album much, and I secretly wonder if was a studio-ordered collaboration between Mike and Karl Jenkins, which may have been difficult for such an independent and determined artist.</p>
<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6ohgMbEWp1F2PUJQLJHTzz" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>The album is nonetheless fantastic and one I listen to very frequently.</p>
<p>Others that I would recommend from this era are &quot;Tubular Bells 3&quot; and &quot;Tr3s Lunas&quot;.</p>
<p>But there are two albums near the beginning and end of this group that are totally different: &quot;Voyager&quot;, which consists mostly of arrangements of folk music, and &quot;Man on the Rocks&quot;, a heavily vocal-led collection which seems to have been a bit of a catharthis from the solely classical &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="origin-story" tabindex="-1">Origin Story <a class="direct-link" href="#origin-story" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Mike had originally started out bringing, as I like to call it, classical structure to rock music. His original few albums had very few track splits, each being around the 20-minute mark.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to hear that Mike was going to go back to this style with &quot;Return to Ommadawn&quot;, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Primarily, it seems this album was &quot;one for the fans&quot; - Mike was rewarding the people who had stuck with him through the years, even if it seemed as if that style of his was a thing of the past. But listening to interviews, it's clear that this is Mike's &quot;home style&quot; - that he's most comfortable with this structure and form of composition.</p>
<p>I must be honest, it took me years to understand and appreciate these albums.</p>
<p>I think my first mistake was believing that I had to enjoy the original Tubular Bells in order to do so. I didn't - and still don't - enjoy the one single album that people generally remember Mike for!</p>
<p>Yes it was a groundbreaking album that displayed a certain genius. But for me, it doesn't resonate for some reason.</p>
<p>Now, going through that early set, I genuinely can say I enjoy these albums as much as the others. Something that helped a great deal was the <a href="spotify:user:11155153810:playlist:1qfqJdIgW34wrt9PADuxcv">Elements album</a>, which showcases shortened excerpts from these longer works.</p>

<h2 id="the-future" tabindex="-1">The Future <a class="direct-link" href="#the-future" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Mike Oldfield has produced a body of work that I constantly go back to. I eagerly anticipate his next work, and appreciate that even if I don't love it, at least I know I will enjoy and appreciate it.</p>
<p>Mike might not be one of those artists who get a vast amount of attention. However, his work on the whole has really resonated with me. I hope this short tour gives you some background and insight into an artist who is multi-layered, complex and deeply moving.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a few tracks to introduce you to his work, I've embedded a few individual tracks on this page that are around the 5 minute mark. Hope you like them!</p>
