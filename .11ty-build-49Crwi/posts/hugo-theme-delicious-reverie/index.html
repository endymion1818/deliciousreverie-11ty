<p><strong>Recently someone reached out to ask if they could use my theme that I use on <a href="http://deliciousreverie.co.uk">deliciousreverie.co.uk</a> on their site. So I've decided to release this theme to the public, albeit with a few changes.</strong></p>
<p>When you're a committed family man, coding outside work is something that of necessity, has to be done in a hurry. Yet it's often the work I most look forward to.</p>
<p>I coded this theme in an awful hurry, but it's served my site well over the past year or more that I've been using it. I started off by examining how the Bootstrap 3 theme output and re-used some of its layout partials when building this theme, in order to save myself some time.</p>
<p>The focus of this theme is it's brevity when it comes to CSS and JavaScript. I wanted to make something that was super fast, especially since this was a static site to be hosted on Netlify, and I wanted to see how quickly I could get it to load. I read Scott Jehl's excellent book &quot;Responsible Responsive Design&quot;, and wanted to implement some of the ideas to reduce time to first byte, first paint time and time to interactivity.</p>
<p>My initial aim was to have only one request: the HTML file, and to inline the CSS and JavaScript. But other things were needed in order not to compromise too much on appearance, so I added a background image, and a WOFF2 font file.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a Favicon.</p>
<p>As a result, It's very minimal indeed, with less than 300 lines of CSS when compiled. The only JavaScript is for the page transitions. It's gone through a few iterations and modular additions over the past 3 years, and I was pleased to hear that someone else liked it and wanted to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/endymion1818/gohugo-theme-deliciousreverie">Here's the code repo</a>. I used Grunt taskrunner, which is what I used for ages before picking up Gulp and Webpack. I still enjoy using it.</p>
<p>So you can just run <code>npm install</code> and then <code>grunt</code> and you'll have regenerated the CSS and JS. Although if you just want to use the theme, you don't even need to do that.</p>

<p>Two things haven't made it into this theme that are present on my website:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Skybird typeface. <a href="https://phitradesign-fonts.com">Philip Trautmann</a> kindly let me use this unique typeface that I feel reflects my personality very well. Before that I used Vollkorn from Google Fonts, so I replaced that font to avoid licencing issues. Although I really recommend you check out Philip's work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homepage animation. The homepage animation uses a ton of JavaScript, including the free version of GreenSock animation library and ScrollMagic. The vector art is also ... umm ... not a small payload ... and I worried that some wouldn't know how to remove this code, causing them performance issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hope-you-like-it-:-d" tabindex="-1">Hope you like it :-D <a class="direct-link" href="#hope-you-like-it-:-d" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>That's all I have to say really, except feel free to clone, download, modify, and use this code. I hope you enjoy doing so!</p>
