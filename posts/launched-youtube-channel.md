title: I launched a YouTube channel

Time flies, as they say, and as I'm getting older (reached 42 this year) I find I have as much to say but less time to say it! And I'm thinking people who are interested in my content are likely to be in the same position. Time is certainly flying.

With that in mind, I [opened my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbL3ZYvJWzJbrbHCgZLDJQ). Here's some of the things I plan to talk about:

1. I opened the channel mostly because I wanted to [teach my kids and others how to code, for which I've created a playlist](https:9//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3rPzXxlZBdnaRBZ-5bwoRA3Hrisdvmk).
2. I like to review and occasionally rant about) open source CMS systems, [which I've already created one video about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGVGRqjtx-o)
3. I'm also mentoring a group of young adults,and [although as of today there's only one video in the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3rPzXxlZBepLYmmRIuBPvrP4S-PnWZq), I'll be adding more videos as we bump into gaps in their knowledge that I think might be advantageous to share with the wider community.

As with anything I make, my hope is that it will benefit at least one other person.
